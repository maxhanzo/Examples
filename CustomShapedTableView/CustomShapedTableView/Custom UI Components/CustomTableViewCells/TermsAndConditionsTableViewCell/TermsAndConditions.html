            The AWS Customer Agreement is the legally binding agreement that Amazon wants you to read and agree to in order to set up an account.
            </p>
            <p>
            In your case, this can be a Terms and Conditions, a Terms of Service, a Terms of Use, a Privacy Policy or a Website Disclaimer that users must read and
            agree to in order to create an account on your web site or mobile app.
            </p>
            <p>
            The same checkbox method should apply to already registered users of your website, mobile app, SaaS app, Facebook app etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you already have registered users and you’re planning an update to the legal agreements, you should provide a notice to users of the changes before the
            effective date of the agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can implement the clickwrap method, with the “<em>I Agree</em>” checkbox, in cases where you are updating your Terms agreement or Privacy Policy
            agreement and you want to notify users about these updates in order to read and accept the new terms.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is how Elance shows a notification on their updated Terms agreement to their registered users.
